# Detection_with_4_ML_Models

# Problem Statement


I have developed a dataset of phishing websites and legitimate websites. The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning algorithm that can detect phishing websites from the entire internet. The dataset is a combination of both Legitimate URLs and phishing URLs. In the end, I compare the ML algorithms used to find the algorithm with a performance most suitable to predict phishing URLs.
